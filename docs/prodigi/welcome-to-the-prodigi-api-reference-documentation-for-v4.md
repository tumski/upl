Welcome to the Prodigi API reference documentation for v4
=========================================================

[Sign up for your free API key](https://dashboard.prodigi.com/register "Sign up for your free API key")

Introduction
============

Our RESTful API is built using standard HTTP response codes, authentication and verbs. We accept `application/json` payloads, and return `JSON` on every response.

Getting started
---------------

Our [guide to placing your first order](/blog/your-first-print-api-order/ "Your first Prodigi API order") walks through our order process, from authentication to submitting an order to our print network.

Environments
============

We have two environments: **Sandbox** and **Live**. Creating a new account on the [Live Dashboard](https://dashboard.prodigi.com/ "Live production dashboard") will automatically set up both a Sandbox and Live account.

Sandbox
-------

Sandbox is our **testing** environment. It **will not fulfil your orders**, and you will **not be charged** for using it.

*   Sandbox API: **api.sandbox.prodigi.com**
*   Sandbox dashboard: [sandbox-beta-dashboard.pwinty.com](https://sandbox-beta-dashboard.pwinty.com/ "Sandbox dashboard")

Live
----

Live is our **production** environment. Any orders that are placed here **will be produced and shipped**.

*   Live API: **api.prodigi.com**
*   Live dashboard: [dashboard.prodigi.com](https://dashboard.prodigi.com/ "Production dashboard")

Authentication
==============

Using the authentication header

    curl "https://api.prodigi.com/v4.0/Orders" \
      -X GET \
      -H "X-API-Key: your-api-key"
    

Each request to our API requires the use of an authentication header: `X-API-Key`.

You can obtain an API key by [signing up for a free Prodigi account](https://dashboard.prodigi.com/register "Sign up for Prodigi").

Your API credentials may differ between Sandbox and Live. If you have issues authenticating, please ensure you are using the correct credentials for that environment.

Orders
======

Creating an order is a single API request, supplying all of the relevant information. Once the order is in our system, we will process it according to your account settings, taking into account any configured pause window. Otherwise, we will start to fulfill it immediately.

### Packing slip

Parameter

Type

Required

Description

`url`

string

no

URL of the packing slip file

`status`

string

no

Status of the packing slip. Set by Prodigi.

### Idempotency key

The`idempotencyKey` is an optional property that can help us determine if your order is a duplicate of an earlier order. If not supplied, the order will not be checked for duplicates.

Most merchants can guarantee that we will only receive one request for one order, so the idempotency key would not be required. For others who may be running distributed systems where it can be harder to guarantee a single request for a single order, the use of the `idempotencyKey` is recommended: a string that is unique to this order.

While the idempotency key can be a simple string, we recommended that you use a GUID of some form to avoid clashes. We remember all your idempotency keys indefinitely, so you need a key of sufficient complexity.

Internally, the idempotency key is scoped to your account, so another merchant's key will never conflict with yours.

We use `idempotencyKey` to check for duplicates rather than `merchantReference` as it's not uncommon for merchants to order reprints of an order using the same `merchantReference`.

### Image resizing

If your image does not fit the product size, by default we will crop your image centrally. We print the image as large as possible, removing the top/bottom or left/right parts of the image that go beyond the print area.

However, you can also specify a sizing parameter to change this behaviour.

Sizing mode

Default?

Description

`fillPrintArea`

yes

Your image will be centred and cropped so that it exactly fits the aspect ratio (height divided by width) of the printing area of the product you chose. Your image will cover all of the product print area.

`fitPrintArea`

no

Your image will be shrunk until the whole image fits within the print area of the product, whilst retaining the aspect ratio of your image. This will usually mean there is white space at the top/bottom or left/right edges.

`stretchToPrintArea`

no

Your image will be resized so that it completely fills the print area of the product. If the aspect ratio of your image is different to that of the printing area, your image will be stretched or squashed to fit.

### Rotation

Pwinty will automatically try to rotate your images so that they need the least possible resizing to fit the product size. For example, if you are creating a 10 x 15 photo, and upload an image that is 4500px x 3000px, then Pwinty will flip it round so it is 3000px x 4500px and thus fits the photo perfectly.

POSTing to the `/orders` endpoint submits and creates your order in Prodigi.

Once an order is submitted and any configured order pause window expires, it begins the [process of fulfillment](#the-order-process "The order process").

Where an order has been submitted and is paused only the order ID is returned in the initial response, with the order status being set to "on hold". For orders in this state, you can continue to make updates to the order via the Prodigi dashboard. Once the pause window expires, a web-hook is triggered containing the full order details.

Please refer to the [Order actions](#order-actions "Order actions") section on more information about updating existing orders. Once an order passes into fulfilment, it can no longer be changed or cancelled.

### Create order outcomes

In addition to the [General outcomes](#outcomes-general-outcomes "General outcomes"), this endpoint can also return:

Outcome

Status code

Description

`created`

200

Order created.

`onHold`

200

Order created on hold due to order edit window preference.

`createdWithIssues`

200

Order created but contains issues that need fixing.

`alreadyExists`

200

Order with the same idempotency key already exists. The new order has not been created, and we have returned the existing order.

Sending a POST request to the `actions/cancel` endpoint for a specific `prodigi_order_id` attempts to cancel the entire order.

Where an order is not yet in fulfilment, the full order will be refunded. Once an order is in fulfilment, and any configured pause window has expired, the shipping charge will be refunded, in line with our [terms and conditions](https://www.prodigi.com/terms-and-conditions/).

If all of the items in the order are cancelled, the resulting returned order will have a status of `cancelled` and all of its shipments will likewise show `cancelled: true`.

If, however, we are only able to cancel some of the items, the resulting order will not have a `cancelled` status and the uncancelled shipments will have `cancelled: false`.

### Request parameters

Parameter

Description

`prodigi_order_id`

The Prodigi ID of the order to cancel.

### Cancel order outcomes

In addition to the [General outcomes](#outcomes-general-outcomes "General outcomes"), this endpoint can also return:

Outcome

Status code

Description

`cancelled`

200

Order successfully cancelled.

`failedToCancel`

200

We could not cancel the order. It could be already in production and too late to cancel.

`actionNotAvailable`

200

Order cannot be cancelled at this time.

Pause an order
--------------

By default all orders submitted via the Print API will be submitted and sent to fulfilment immediately.

Through the [Prodigi dashboard](https://dashboard.prodigi.com) you can configure a pause window for all orders to adhere to, either by setting an amount of time for all orders to be paused, or you can configure orders to be paused indefinitely, requiring orders to then be submitted manually through the dashboard.

Once a configured pause window expires, the order will submit for fulfilment and a callback will be sent informing you of this.

Update shipping method

We can send callbacks to your chosen endpoint when an order's stage changes or when a shipment is made (see [Status](#status "Status") for details of the Status and Shipments objects).

A callback requires a public url, which can be given globally as a setting in your merchant settings in the [dashboard](https://dashboard.prodigi.com/ "Prodigi dashboard"), or on a per-order basis by setting the `callbackUrl` in the [Order](#order-object "Order object") object.

Each callback is in the form of a CloudEvent following the [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/ "CloudEvents") specification.

Properties
----------

### source `URI-reference`

The `source` identifies the context in which an event happened. This is a URI that points at the host [environment](#environments "Environments") that has produced the callback and the API endpoint that can be used to access the particular source object.

For example for sandbox this would be:

`https://api.sandbox.prodigi.com/v4.0/Orders/`

And the live api:

`https://api.prodigi.com/v4.0/Orders/`

[View the CloudEvents spec ↗](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md#source-1 "CloudEvents spec for source")

### id `string`

The identifier for the event. Each event ID is unique and starts with the `evt_` prefix.

[View the CloudEvents spec ↗](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md#id "CloudEvents spec for id")

### type `string`

The `type` property starts with the `com.prodigi` reverse DNS name. This is then followed by the high-level object that is responsible for generating the callback, which in most cases is the [Order](#order-object "Order object") object followed by the path to the nested object that has changed. Finally, the new value is given as part of a fragment (followed by the `#` character).

For example:

`com.prodigi.order.status.stage.changed#InProgress`

This shows a change to the order stage: the change is to the order status and it has changed to `InProgress`.

[View the CloudEvents spec ↗](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md#type "CloudEvents spec for type")

Callback Payload

     "data": {
          "id": "ord_1469466",
          "created": "2020-08-14T11:50:54.557Z",
          "status": {
            "stage": "InProgress"
          }
     }
    

### subject `string`

Used to identify the particular object that produced the callback. In the case of the Prodigi API's callbacks this will be the order id.

### dataContentType `String`

Always `application/json`.

### time `timestamp`

The datetime the event was generated, in [RFC3339 time format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339 "RFC3339 time format"). Please note that this time may differ from the actual delivery time of the event because callbacks are queued for delivery.

[View the CloudEvents spec ↗](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md#time "CloudEvents spec for time")

### specversion `string`

The version of the CloudEvents specification which the event uses. In our case this is version `1.0`.

[View the CloudEvents spec ↗](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md#specversion "CloudEvents spec for specversion")

### data `json`

Data object of the complete [order](#order-object "Order object") object at the point the callback was created.

ID format
=========

To aid parsing, all Prodigi-assigned IDs in the API have a 3-letter prefix according to the object type which it identfies.

The `outcome` helps you understand what is happening with your order, and what has happened as a result of each request.

This is especially useful with larger orders, when a change across the whole order (like updating shipping, or cancelling the order) may have impacted your individual shipments.

This field is available on every request.

General outcomes
----------------

The range of returned `outcome` values varies between endpoints, but the general list of possible `outcomes` is as follows

Outcome

The order process
=================

Understanding how we process and fulfill orders will help you understand our API.

Our order process consists of the following steps:

1.  [Order creation](#the-order-process-1-order-creation)
2.  [Assets download](#the-order-process-2-assets-download)
3.  [Lab allocation](#the-order-process-3-lab-allocation)
4.  [Asset preparation](#the-order-process-4-asset-preparation)
5.  [Lab submission](#the-order-process-5-lab-submission)
6.  [Production](#the-order-process-6-production)
7.  [Shipping](#the-order-process-7-shipping)
8.  [Order completion](#the-order-process-8-order-completion)

During the order's lifecycle, we can send you [callbacks](#callbacks "Callbacks") with information on how the order is progressing. We can send callbacks when the following events occur:

*   After the "Create order" stage
*   After the "Shipments made" stage
*   After the "Order completed" stage

1\. Order creation
------------------

The order is created by POSTing to the `/orders` endpoint. Once any pre-configured pause window has expired, it moves into fulfilment.

*   Order stage: `In progress`
*   Callback available: no

2\. Assets download
-------------------

We download your assets from your source URIs. We ensure that they are available for processing, and are available should the order need to be resubmitted or checked for quality.

For details of how long we keep the original and transformed images see [image retention](#the-order-process-image-retention "Image retention") below.

*   Order stage: `In progress`
*   Callback available: yes, once complete

3\. Lab allocation
------------------

When allocating your order, we allocate to the most cost-effective lab based on the chosen products, destination and shipping method. This may require us to split the order into multiple shipments.

Once this process has been completed, the [order](#order-object "Order object") that is returned by the API shows the allocated [shipments](#order-object-shipment "Shipments") for the order items.

Image retention
---------------

When an order is submitted, we immediately save copies of the order's image assets. We retain these for 30 days, after which they are deleted automatically.

This 30-day period is in case we need to resubmit your order at any point, for example to a different lab.

Versions
--------

The current version of the API is **v4**.

### Earlier versions

All earlier versions of the API have been discontinued and are no longer available. For guidance on upgrading to v4 please see the [Migration Guide](/blog/migrating-from-api-v3-to-v4/ "Migrating to v4 of the Prodigi API").

### Changes & breaking changes

We consider a breaking change to be one where we need to remove fields or values. We will not roll out any breaking changes in a given version, instead favouring a minor version increase. We may release additional fields or endpoints without a version bump as we don't consider these breaking changes.
